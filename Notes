Visibility And Atomicity

Visibility : is about seeing or getting most up to  date information of any object, while working on a multithreaded environment we end up having the
             stale data if two threads are working symyltaniously.
      solution is  : volatile key word and synchronized bloack. 

Atomicity  : is Race condition,
              were we encounter the situation at which two threads might update the same resource incompletly. 
              which might lead to currupted data.
