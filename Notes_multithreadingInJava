Visibility And Atomicity

Visibility : is about seeing or getting most up to  date information of any object, while working on a multithreaded environment we end up having the
             we might encounter with stale data if two threads are working symyltaniously.
             solution is  : volatile key word and synchronized block. 
Example :
          private static volatile boolean stopRequested = false;  -- everytime you update resourse. it is intemated to all the other 
           data threads who are accessing them. 

Atomicity  : is Race condition,
              were we encounter the situation at which two threads might update the same resource incompletly. 
              which might lead to currupted data.
                Operations as single individual unit. 
                  using atomic integers and concurrent locks packages..

Example :
